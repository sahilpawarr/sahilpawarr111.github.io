## Hi, I’m Sahil!

I recently graduated with honors in economics from the **[Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics](https://gipe.ac.in/)**. I am passionate about economic development,fiscal policy and venture capital. 

Currently, i’m working as an Analyst - Founder's Office at **[Cambridge Wealth](https://www.cambridgewealth.in/)**, a fintech startup in the wealth management space, where I work as Chief of Staff to the CEO's office. My role largely involves working at the intersection of data, business and finance. 

While at university, I interned for the **[Standord Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/)** for the **[FUSE](fuse.stanford.edu)** project where I did field research and data analysis on the FWE consumption during Covid-19 and was a project intern at the **[Policy Research Organisation](policyresearch.in)** where I worked with historical data of Pune Municipal Corporation's annual budgets, to offer informed policy recommendations to local policymakers. Additionally, I interned at **[Evolve](evolveinc.io)** for their Growth and Analytics team and as a UX researcher at **[Moonraft Innovation Labs](moonraft.com)** where I worked on the strategy to execute a virtual reality metaverse project for a global tech event.  

I am a generalist at heart and possess an inherent curiosity to dive into practically everything around me that I wish to find answers to. I’ve always said my perfect career would be whatever pays me to just learn everything all the time for no specific reason. like a scholar for hire.
