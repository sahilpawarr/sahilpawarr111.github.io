About me
========
Hi, I’m Sahil. I recently graduated with honors in economics from the **Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics**. Currently, i’m working as a Founder’s Office Associate at [Cambridge Wealth]([http](https://www.cambridgewealth.in/), an early stage fintech startup, where my role involves working directly with the CEO on business strategy, system design, growth and research.   

I am a generalist at heart and possess an inherent curiosity to dive into practically everything around me that I wish to find answers to. I’ve always said my perfect career would be whatever pays me to just learn everything all the time for no specific reason. like a scholar for hire.

My interests broadly lie in the intersection of development economics, public finance, venture capital and economic history.
